## 1.	Introduction
During our internship at EcloudValley, we encountered a significant challenge in the realm of web application security: the complex and time-consuming process of setting up a Web Application Firewall (WAF). This task, critical for protecting web applications from various cyber threats, often proves to be a frustrating and resource-intensive endeavor for many organizations.

### 1.1. The difficulties in WAF setup stem from several factors

1.	Complex Configuration: WAF deployment requires navigating through intricate settings and options, demanding a deep understanding of both web security principles and the specific WAF platform being used.

2.	 Rule Research and Design: Effective WAF protection necessitates extensive research into current threat landscapes and the careful design of rules to counter these threats. This process is both time-consuming and requires specialized knowledge.

3.	Continuous Updates: The ever-evolving nature of cyber threats means that WAF rules and configurations need frequent updates, adding to the ongoing maintenance burden.

4.	Resource Intensiveness: The combination of initial setup and ongoing management often requires dedicated personnel, which can strain resources, especially for smaller organizations.

### 1.2. Our vision
Recognizing these challenges, we envisioned a solution that could revolutionize the way organizations approach WAF deployment and management. We wanted to create a tool that would:

-	Simplify the WAF setup process, making it accessible to a broader range of users
-	Reduce the time and resources required for effective WAF deployment
-	Leverage cutting-edge AI technology to provide intelligent, context-aware security implementation
-	Offer flexibility to cater to both novice users and experienced security professionals




### 1.3. Introducing WAF Manager
To address these needs, we developed "WAF Manager" - an innovative solution designed to streamline and enhance the WAF deployment process. WAF Manager serves as a comprehensive platform that combines:

1.	AI-Powered Assistance: Utilizing advanced natural language processing to guide users through WAF setup and provide intelligent rule suggestions.

2. AI-Assisted Rapid Response:
-	You switch to AI Mode and type:
**Urgent**: Need WAF rule to protect against CVE-2023-45102 exploitation targeting our payment processing system. Attack from new IP range. I want to build it on us-east-1 alb, with arn `“arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-east-1:************:loadbalancer/app/alb/a7576322d443f617”`
     
-	WAF Manager's AI immediately understands the urgency and context.

3. Intelligent Rule Generation:
-	The AI analyzes the CVE details, your system architecture, and recent attack patterns.
-	Within seconds, it recommend the engineer to use the rule packages that fits.
4. Fast Deployment:
-	With the rules finalized, you enter "generate"
-	The AI will show the configuration for final check. If everything is correct, enter “deploy” to submit the configuration.

### 2.3. Outcome

Thanks to WAF Manager:

-	The engineer mitigated a critical threat within 15 minutes of detection.
-	Customer data remained secure, preventing a potentially costly data breach.

This scenario demonstrates how WAF Manager's combination of AI-driven intelligence, user-friendly interface, and rapid deployment capabilities can be crucial in responding to urgent security threats, even in challenging circumstances.
     
 
## 3.	Architecture
The WAF Manager employs a modern, cloud-native architecture designed for scalability, reliability, and ease of use. This section provides an overview of the system's key components and their interactions.
### 3.1. System Overview

The WAF Manager consists of three main components:
1.	Front-end Application
2.	Back-end Systems
3.	Cloud Infrastructure

These components work together to provide a seamless experience for users configuring and managing their Web Application Firewalls.

### 3.2. Front-end Application

The front-end is built using Vue.js 3, offering two primary modes of interaction:
1.	AI Mode: A conversational interface leveraging AI to assist users in WAF configuration.
2.	Manual Mode: A structured form interface for direct control over WAF settings.
Key features include:
•	Responsive design for various devices
•	Real-time updates and notifications
•	Markdown rendering for AI responses
•	Progress tracking for WAF deployment
